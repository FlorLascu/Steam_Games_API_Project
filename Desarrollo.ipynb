    "# Step 1 - Starting out our ETL Process\n",
    "We started out by reading the Data Glossary to understand the structure and content of the three files provided with the project documentation: \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **steam_games.json.gz**: This dataset contains comprehensive information about the games available on Steam. It encompasses details such as game titles, genres, release dates,etc... allowing us to gain insights into the **gaming catalog**. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **user_reviews.json**: The user reviews dataset provides user-generated feedback for Steam games. It contains data such as review text and rating feedback votes, enabling us to analyze user sentiments and experiences effectively.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **users_items.json**: In this dataset, we find data related to Steam users and their collections of in-game items. <br>\n",
    "The insightful data from this dataset includes user preferences and the specific items they own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we reviewed the structure, column definitions and set up, we proceeded to load them into Pandas Dataframes in order to access the information to transform and process.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Games\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceeded with the [ETL_games](ETL_games.ipynb) : **steam_games.json.gz** without inconvenients:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe was named df_games, containing:<br>\n",
    "*   120.445 rows\n",
    "*   13 columns \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Using Data Wrangler, we get  a general idea of the dataset, it contains many missing values, most columns have up to 70% missing values in the dataset.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    ">We will be deleting the missing information since, first we can't complete the missing information since it is diverse and the source is unknown.<br>\n",
    ">Also, deleting missing information still provides us with more than enough information to our project. There is no loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are left with 22.530 rows and 13 columns  of information <br>\n",
    "We now need to evaluate each column in order to decide which columns are important for the project and which columns can be deleted<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To follow, we will delete duplicates, only 2 registers were eliminated<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now, we can start to define which columns we do need to keep. <br>\n",
    "Columns that we already know that are necessary for the API functions: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **publisher** for function **def developer**\n",
    "*   **genres** for function **def user_for_genre**\n",
    "*   **release date** for function **def best_developer_year**\n",
    "*   **price** for function **def user_data**\n",
    "*   **titles** for **def best_developer_year**\n",
    "*   **id** identifies each game for its unique id value\n",
    "*   **developer** for function **def developer**\n",
    "##### These above columns, will be transformed and manipulated as part of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Also, we can start to evaluate the information from other columns in order to delete columns that we don't need from our dataset.<br>\n",
    "##### These are:\n",
    "*   **app_name** similar information as in title\n",
    "*   **url** does not bring value to the intended project\n",
    "*   **tags** similar to genres and does not bring value to the intended project\n",
    "*   **discount_price** does not bring value to the intended project\n",
    "*   **reviews_url** does not bring value to the intended project\n",
    "*   **specs** does not bring value to the intended project\n",
    "*   **early access** does not bring value to the intended project\n",
    "\n",
    "##### So all the above columns will be deleted   \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding value to our data:\n",
    "*   We convert **price** into an all float column, so all info about Free and promotions is turned into zeros.\n",
    "*   We create a new column = **release_year** and delete the previous column **release_year** this new column will be used in the function **best_developer_year**\n",
    "*   We drop all columns that don't add to the model or functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now there is one last column that we need to analyze and transform: 'genres'\n",
    "##### genres\n",
    "This column contains a list in each of the rows indicating to which genres does the game belong to. <br>\n",
    "A **video game genre** is a category that groups games based on objectives, story, and gameplay.<br>\n",
    "It helps users and developers identify games with similar styles and themes, like the intense challenges in action games or character development and quests in role-playing games.\n",
    "In this column, for each game (row) we find a list of genres that the game features.<br>\n",
    "This information will be used  in the function **user_for_genre** and our recommendation model<br>\n",
    "But we will do this in our EDA, for now we will continue with our ETL stages.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We store the transformed dataframe in [games.parquet](games.parquet) in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 User_Reviews\n",
    "When moving on to our second file [ETL_user_reviews](ETL_user_reviews.ipynb), we were faced with our first challenge:<br>\n",
    "The standard proceedure to read the file used in the first file resulted in error after error, because the data inside the .json file was not in the expected format.<br>\n",
    "After investigating I learned that when the JSON file you are trying to load is not properly formatted (which is the case here), you can evaluate it line by line using **ast.literal_eval()**. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After extensive searching and delving into Stack Overflow, I stumbled upon an article that was a breakthrough:\n",

    "*   3 columns\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First we proceed to identify missing or duplicated values.\n",
    "We encountered 623 duplicated registers, we validate that they are in fact duplicated and we finally delete the duplicated value keeping just the first occurence of the value.<br>\n",
    "Then we move forward into the reviews column which is of the most interest to our project.<br>\n",
    " \n",
    "It was easy to detect that the third column was a collection of list of dictionaries, and that data inside the last column is vital for the development of the sentiment analysis.<br>\n",

    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "-   Provides a wide range of tools and resources for natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "-   Flexible and customizable for advanced NLP tasks.\n",
    "-   Well-established community and extensive documentation.\n",

    "**Disadvantages**:\n",

    "\n",
    "In our case we studied and implemented both methods, you can review in detail in [Feature Engineering](03.%20Feature%20Engineering.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceeded following the process of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing and Tokenization**: This step involves cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis. It includes tasks such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and handling special characters.\n",
    "Tokenization involves breaking down the text into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "> We chose to perform this by creating a new column, named 'clean_review' and passing a function to the 'review_text' column  content and storing this transformation, for each element in the 'clean_review' \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Once the text data is prepared, sentiment analysis can be performed. There are several libraries and techniques available for sentiment analysis, including lexicon-based approaches, machine learning models, and deep learning models.\n",
    "We set to define the sentiment classification into:\n",
    "*   Negative = 0 for all values where compound_score was under - 0.05\n",
    "*   Neutral = 1 all other results nor negative nor positive and none values or emojis.\n",
    "*   Positive = 2 for all values where compound_score was above 0.05\n",
    "> For our work, we chose to work with Vader. ALthough Textblob is a suitable solution because is much faster and simpler, when comparing both results, the only disadvanage of NLTK was the use of resources, the model runs slow, but the outcome is better.\n",
    ">NLTK is more assertive in classifing negative and positive sentiments, but even better for neurtral classification.\n",
    "In the [Feature Engineering](03.%20Feature%20Engineering.ipynb) you can review in detail the process for both approaches and our analysis, and then in the [EDA_reviews](EDA_reviews.ipynb) you can find the comparison of the results for both approaches and more exploration.<br>\n",

    "1. **Developer** number of games and percentage of Free content by developer by year.<br>\n",
    "2. **User_data**: how much money has the user spent, what percentage, from the total number of games the user owns, has the user recommended from the reviews.recommend and how many games he purchased.<br>\n",
    "3. **User_for_genres**: this function must return the user with the largest amount of minutes for the given genres and a list of minutes accumulated per year since the release date<br>\n",
    "4. **Best_developer_year**: this function returns the top 3 developers based on the largest amount of recommendations for the given year (reviews.recommend = True and sentiment = 2)<br>\n",
